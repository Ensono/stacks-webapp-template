# PROJECT_NAME

DESCRIPTION:
---
this sets up monitoring and alerting

PREREQUISITES:
---
Azure Subscripion
  - SPN 
    - Terraform will use this to perform the authentication for the API calls
    - you will need the `client_id, subscription_id, client_secret, tenant_id`

Terraform backend
  - resource group (can be manually created for the terraform remote state)
  - Blob storage container for the remote state management


USAGE:
---

To activate the terraform backend for running locally we need to initialise the SPN with env vars to ensure you are running the same way as the pipeline that will ultimately be running any incremental changes.

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/opt/tf-lib amidostacks/ci-tf:latest /bin/bash
```

```bash 
export ARM_CLIENT_ID=xxxx \
ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=yyyyy \
ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=yyyyy \
ARM_TENANT_ID=yyyyy
```

alternatively you can run `az login` 

To get up and running locally you will want to create  a `terraform.tfvars` file 
```bash
TFVAR_CONTENTS='''
vnet_id                 = "amido-stacks-vnet-uks-dev"
rg_name                 = "amido-stacks-rg-uks-dev"
resource_group_location = "uksouth"
name_company            = "amido"
name_project            = "stacks"
name_component          = "spa"
name_environment        = "dev" 
'''
$TFVAR_CONTENTS > terraform.tfvars
```

```
terraform workspace select dev || terraform workspace new dev
```

terraform init -backend-config=./backend.local.tfvars

To call the module you'll need:
 - your alert name
 - resource group name
 - application insights id
 - query written in the kusto formatting

Kusto is an SQL like language used, in this case, to query logs, you can get more information here
