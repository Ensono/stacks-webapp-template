## Requirements

We are supporting and running [node@12](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).

Please ensure that your local environment has the correct version
[installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

We are leveraging [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for dependency management - follow the
installation instructions for your OS [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

For package management, we are using [Lerna](https://lernajs.io) which can be installed using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lerna).


## To start

`npm install` to install the dev dependencies from the root.

`npm run postinstall` to bootstrap the packages in the current Lerna repo. Installs
all of their dependencies and links any cross-dependencies.

## Tests

##### Static

`npm run lint`: runs global linting from root level, ensuring all packages are
following conventions specified in [.eslintrc](.eslintrc).

`npm run prettier`: runs formatting from root level, ensuring all packages are
following conventions specified in [.prettierrc](.prettierrc).

`npm run validate`: ensures that the project adheres to Typescript checks,
formatting and linting rules.

`npm run test`: runs the unit tests for all packages.

## Web Application

```bash
# To run locally:
