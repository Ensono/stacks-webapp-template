## ESLint Configuration Usage

Shared ESLint config to guide a consistent code style across front end
development in (and outside!) [Amido](https://amido.com).

### Installation

Our default export contains all of our ESLint rules. The configuration was built
based on other open source configuration. To run and use with your project, we
must install peer dependencies.

1. To start run `npm install --only=dev @amidostacks/eslint-config` to save as a
   dev dependency
2. Install peer dependecies with the correct versions:
   `npx install-peerdeps --only=dev @amidostacks/eslint-config`

## Usage

After installing, simply add a `.eslintrc` file the following to your project
root (at the same level as `package.json`):

```json
{
  "extends": ["@amidostacks/eslint-config"]
}
```

In your `package.json` add a script to run linting:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "node_modules/.bin/eslint . -f codeframe"
  }
```
