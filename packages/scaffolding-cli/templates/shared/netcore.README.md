# stacks-dotnet

DotNet example application and scaffolding for Amido Stacks

## Definitions

### Application

Throughout this document, the term application will refer to a set of services that together form a component in a bigger solution. I.E: An e-commerce portal, will have multiple small applications like catalog, checkout,
composed of services like front-end, APIs, cache, worker. *We should avoid the term component because everything is a component of a bigger solution and it makes harder to identify the context.*

### Service

Is the term we will use to describe a component that provides a specific set of
features in the application scope. ie:

- ***UI** is the front-end service that provides pages for users to navigate and access the application features.*
- ***API** is a service that provides endpoints to interact with the application resources either by UI or by other applications.*
  
## Repository Structure

```
├── build
│   ├── azDevOps: stores configuration, build steps and scripts used by azure dev ops only
│   ├── jenkins: stores configuration, build steps and scripts used by jenkins only
│   └── scripts: stores scripts used by build steps that can be resused by multiple 
|                tools without changes. ie: Docker script for Container Image creation
├── deploy
|   ├── k8s: stores yaml files for k8s deployments. i.e: deployments, services, 
|   |   |     configMap and related dependencies for each service in an application
|   |   ├── ui: stores yaml for ui service
|   |   └── api: stores yaml for the api service and configuration files
│   │       ├── base: store raw yaml used by k8s
│   │       ├── kustomization: store kustomize files(for kubectl apply -k)
│   │       │   ├── dev: configuration files for dev environment
│   │       │   └── test: configuration files for test environment
│   │       └── helm-chart: store helm chart files(if helm used)
│   │           └── templates
|   ├── serviceFabric: scripts used to deploy applications on serviceFabric
|   ├── terraform: terraform scripts used to provision dependencies only needed by this application
|   └── scripts: deployment scripts shared by multiple tools. ie: Variable substitution
├── contracts: stores swagger specs, ui mocks and other documents describing the overall solution
└── src
    ├── api: stores the solution for the api 
    ├── services (i.e: queue listerner, scheduled jobs) [TBD]
    ├── tests: stores tests not built in other services solutions(functional tests, performance, etc)  
    └── ui: stores the front end service and components
```

## Deploying this application

This solution has two build pipelines files one each for Azure DevOps and Jenkins, located under `./build/azDevOps/azure` and `./build/Jenkins/` respectively. To deploy this application, fork it into your desired source control system and point your Jenkins or Azure DevOps instance at those pipeline files. There are a number of prerequisite variables (such as credentials) and various paths that must be populated, all of which are listed at the head of the file (if global) or in the relevant environment section (if per-environment). Please refer to the `stacks-infrastructure` repository for more information around the provisioning of the underlying infrastructure.

### Deployment files

When deployed to a kubernetes cluster, ensure the following requirements are satisfied:
- The yaml files for the resources are created in the folder /deploy/k8s/api/base
- The yaml files for kustomization are created for each environment. i.e: /deploy/k8s/api/kustomization/dev
- The kustomization files apply the changes required to the environment
- The required secrets are deployed to the cluster (do not check in secrets or certificates to the repository)
