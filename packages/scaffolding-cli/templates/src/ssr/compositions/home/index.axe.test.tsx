/*
We expect every component to pass our accessibility checks. By using jest-axe we get fast feedback whilst developing.

⚠️ IMPORTANT:
    Note that this will render the component, without notion of the document as a whole.
    To test the end user result with the components rendered in Page by Next, please
    use Cypress with Axe.
    Example: index.test.axe.cy.ts
